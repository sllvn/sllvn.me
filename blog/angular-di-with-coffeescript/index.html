		<h2>Angular controller dependency injection with Coffeescript</h2>
		<div class="date">2013-08-06</div>
	
	<p>After reading that Angular’s new “controller as” syntax available in 1.1.5 works quite nicely with Coffeescript, I was inspired to port some existing Javascript/Angular code to Coffeescript. What was not immediately apparent, however, was how to inject dependencies when using a Coffeescript class as the meat of an Angular controller.</p>
<p>I finally settled upon something like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="javascript" class="language-javascript z-code"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="z-source z-ts"><span class="z-variable z-other z-object z-ts">myApp</span><span class="z-punctuation z-accessor z-ts">.</span><span class="z-variable z-other z-property z-ts">controller</span> <span class="z-string z-quoted z-single z-ts"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-string z-begin z-ts">&#39;</span>YoloController<span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-string z-end z-ts">&#39;</span></span><span class="z-punctuation z-separator z-comma z-ts">,</span><span class="z-meta z-array z-literal z-ts"> <span class="z-meta z-brace z-square z-ts">[</span><span class="z-string z-quoted z-single z-ts"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-string z-begin z-ts">&#39;</span>$resource<span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-string z-end z-ts">&#39;</span></span><span class="z-punctuation z-separator z-comma z-ts">,</span>
  <span class="z-meta z-class z-ts"><span class="z-storage z-type z-class z-ts">class</span> <span class="z-entity z-name z-type z-class z-ts">YoloController</span>
    <span class="z-entity z-name z-type z-class z-ts">constructor</span>: (<span class="z-entity z-name z-type z-class z-ts">$resource</span>) -&gt;
      @<span class="z-entity z-name z-type z-class z-ts">Hipster</span> = <span class="z-entity z-name z-type z-class z-ts">$resource</span>(&#39;/<span class="z-entity z-name z-type z-class z-ts">hipsters</span>&#39;)
      @<span class="z-entity z-name z-type z-class z-ts">hipsters</span> = @<span class="z-entity z-name z-type z-class z-ts">Hipsters</span>.<span class="z-entity z-name z-type z-class z-ts">query</span>()
]
</span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Obviously, you would want to move this resource into a service. And if you needed to use the injection in other class methods, you would want to assign it to a class variable, using Coffeescript’s convenient constructor assignment syntax (note the @ sign): <code>constructor: (@$resource) -&gt;</code></p>
