		<h2>Using Slack at home</h2>
		<div class="date">2015-12-13</div>
	
	<p>After reading about Facebook Messenger’s <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-messenger-testing-facial-recognition-technology-2015-11">complete disregard for user privacy</a>, I moved communication with the girlfriend over to Slack. We are apparently <a href="https://medium.com/@msquinn/slack-after-hours-306d37e67722">not the first to do so</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve been happy with the experience. Search, totally absent from FB Messenger, is great. Multi-channeled communication is quite useful for home communication (we separate messages by topic: #home, #groceries, or just #general chat). Additionally, we’ve spun up a <a href="https://hubot.github.com/">chatbot</a> to manage shared lists (e.g., groceries) and tell us when our morning bus is arriving.</p>
<p>It would be great to have more contextual awareness in the Slack app, however. Location, especially, would be nice to have for more relevant chatbot responses. “Where’s my bus?” is a lot more natural than “Where’s the 28 southbound on 34th street?”</p>
<p>I’ve shared my hubot scripts at <a href="https://github.com/licyeus/home-hubot">https://github.com/licyeus/home-hubot</a>.</p>
