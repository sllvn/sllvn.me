Visited friends in Austin last week and tried to explore the city by foot / transit as much as possible. The transit system, despite the challenges of a sprawling car-centric city, had some advantages over Seattle: real-time data was reliably available (in Seattle, real-time data is spotty) and the ability to pay fare by credit card or by mobile app (Seattle's dated ORCA card takes 24-48 hours to process reloads).

But the challenges of a sprawling, traffic-filled city proved too much for relying solely on buses (e.g., one 80-minute trip on transit would've been equally fast by foot) and I eventually started bugging friends for lifts around town. Dragged them to the downtown library and made them get library cards as a sort of penance. The Austin library is awesome: interesting architecture without being overwrought (a la Seattle's), lots of space to hang out including shaded balconies overlooking the river.
